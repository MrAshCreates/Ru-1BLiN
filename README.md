# RulBlin / Ru-1 BLiN
RulBlin is a STEM-inspired experience filled with math and science References and terms to use to survive, thrive, and make others die. 

**Title Meaning:** "Rulblin" means the word "Rule" and was inspired by a video (linked below). It was combined with other meanings and variations of "Rule" until I found a title that sounded interesting. Pronounce it like "Rule Blend" with a silent "d," but any pronunciation is valid as it is a made-up word. I'm considering adding a "-1" to the title in different positions to align with the game's concepts, such as "Ru-1 Blin" or "Rul B-1in."

**Chemical Elements Inspiration:** Ru-1 (Ruthenium) + B (Boron) + Li (Lithium) + Nitrogen = "Ru-1 BLiN"

## Gameplay

The gameplay of RulBlin is a STEM-inspired experience filled with math and science terms and ideas that may be unfamiliar to most players. This approach aims to make learning these concepts more accessible. The game's rules are simple yet crucial: "Never trust zero." If anything equals zero, it disappears. Weapons out of ammo disappear, and if your character runs out of energy, you disappear. Another fundamental rule is that everything must follow the rules of science; otherwise, you can't complete the action. You can create, remove, or modify a rule periodically, as long as it doesn't violate the principles of STEM. Players battle against each other using STEM knowledge. RulBlin offers various classes, each with its subject and tools to use against opponents. Your goal is to survive and build your empire. You can form teams, networks, and organizations to collaborate and grow or play alone, leveraging your real-world subject knowledge to shape the game world.

## Development

The game will initially be programmed in C++ using Unity to create basic concepts and ideas. As the team expands, we plan to switch to C# and Unreal Engine to enhance graphics and capabilities. This transition will increase system requirements over time, making RulBlin a higher-end game and product.
