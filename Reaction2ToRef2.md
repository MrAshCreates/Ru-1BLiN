hi I'm Tyler fols I'm a nuclear engineer with little over 10 years of experience in the commercial nuclear power industry from engineering to operations to Emergency Response don't claim to know everything there is to know nuclear but I can certainly share some knowledge today we're going to be looking at a video called animation versus math now as a nuclear engineer I took quite a bit of math from statistics to calculus to partial differential equations though might be a bit Rusty on calculus I haven't really taken it much since College I mainly use statistics in my day-to-day operations at the office so we'll see how much of this I remember let's take a look
a little stick dude
good place to start with a one
that is so cool how he manipulates the shapes into doing that that is just awesome by the way a bit of a joke here so one plus one equals two according to mathematicians some scientists uh one plus one equals 2.0 if they're very confident with the results of their experiment but for engineers one plus one we know it's two but a lot of times we call it three because just to add a little extra safety margin just to be absolutely sure we accounted for everything now nuclear Engineers one plus one is about a hundred because there is so much additional margin we throw into designing nuclear facilities that we literally prepare for one plus one to be 100 especially after the Fukushima event happened um I have so many additional backup systems including ones that are on site for our already existing backup systems and ones that can be brought in by helicopter if necessary so yes that's what you get when you get one plus one equals 100 a super robust defense in-depth design system but hey gonna prevent things like Fukushima from ever happening again
love the sound effects
that is so cool
getting them bigger
thank you
how excited he was about making a hundred that's awesome
now it's small
from addition known to subtraction
oh
I'm not sure how much the average person actually knows about this but okay um so minus one is e to the I times pi so e um Euler's number about 2.7 and some change Pi a lot of you probably know this one 3.14 and some change both irrational numbers that's how you express them and I is the square root of negative one so e Rays to the I times pi is equivalent to negative one and there's even this little thing that mathematicians like to call called Euler's identity which is e to the I times pi plus one equals zero because mathematicians like to express everything equal to zero for reasons that I don't understand but yeah that's just a very fancy way of writing negative one it's awesome
what's alive
it's probably irrational
that was it it didn't just multiply Itself by an eye to enter the shadow the imaginary Realm
equations and balance
oh he changed the sign yeah there we go I like to think this is how math was discovered just one guy figuring out all the numbers uh systematically I wonder if there's historical context here
multiplication
this is so cool
thank you

this is so cool
foreign
such a beautiful way to teach math people in math classes should show this they could get everyone all fired up the thing that I kind of struggled with in math as an engineer was like okay it's just all conceptual it's like how do I apply this how do I build something with this and this can is really a beautiful illustration of what numbers can look like when you when you visualize them when you visualize these operations that they're doing like exponents multiplication division it's so so cool and I think more people would be in the math
thank you
there we go especially for proofs yeah proof that four to the zero equals one or four to the one equals four just do it just manipulate the number then watch everything pop out wish you could see this on a test someone just submits a video answer like this that that is so cool
uh-oh other dimensions are coming in
yeah use a positive one
is that what that was did this whole thing just prove e to the I times pi equals negative one if you ever get that question on a test just send them this video
Gotta Do
there we go foreign

they fixed the world
thank you
guys send him back to his dimension
yep made infinity
is he gonna eat the pie
there you go you just proved the existence of Pi is he going to eat the pie
oh exit that's clever yeah with the eyes
yep you make four of those it turns into a one
they're in the imaginary world look at all those negative square roots down there and it's it's upside down and it's underneath the normal world of on the Cartesian plane that is that is brilliant uh this is a very very clever video I love it
uh-oh other dimensions are coming in
use a positive one
is that what that was did this whole thing just prove e to the I times pi equals negative one if you ever get that question on a test just send them this video
