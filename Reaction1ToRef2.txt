hello maths fans Dr Tom grawford here at
the University of Oxford and today I'm
trying something completely different
this will be my first ever reaction
video as I react to the YouTube
sensation animation versus math by Alan
Becker there's been a lot of chat about
this video in the maths community and
possibly even more in the YouTube maths
community and lots of you have even
gotten in touch to ask my opinion on the
video or if I have even watched the
video and my answer is I haven't this is
genuinely the first time I am going to
sit down and watch any part of what I
believe is a masterpiece so I will be
recording everything as it happens so
you all get to experience firsthand my
real reaction to the video
let's get started
Euler
okay orange stick man love it already
and the number one
okay
one does equal one solid

[Music]

okay one plus one is two

[Music]

one plus one plus one is three
is this gonna test my mental arrangement

okay we're up to ten we're up to ten all
right

[Music]

oh
he's had enough of the ones I like it if
he's trying to get big numbers this is
sensible
oh under 20. okay
is this just something it's just a
character Infinity
okay
all right so we're on Triple figures
we've got up to 100
he looked pretty tired

[Music]

now he's subtracting

[Music]

oh oh oh this is a pause moment
so the minus one became e to the I Pi I
like that so that's Euler's identity so
I actually have a tattoo of this sort of
here but mine says ease the I pi plus
one is equal to zero so here they've
obviously rearranged that a little bit
and done e to the I Pi is minus one and
then his minus one is now turned into an
e to the I Pi that's nice okay that's
the first bit of like
I don't know let's say advanced math
that has come into this
very cool all right let's just go next
Multiplication Division
okay he's running away as it does
who doesn't get annoyed when they lose
their e right

[Music]

neat

[Music]

oh he's figured out multiplication
interesting

[Music]

now we've got division okay
I'm gonna we're gonna pause again
interesting that we we had plus and
minus
various things going on there
and then we went to eat a guy pie just
to throw in complex numbers and
irrational numbers transcendental
numbers in fact and now we're bringing
in multiplication and division okay so
we're only two and a bit minutes in out
of 14. so I'm a little worried that's
how advanced this might get assuming
this is just going to get more and more
advanced I genuinely have no idea okay
Properties of Powers

[Music]

oh

dividing by zero it's not going to end
well

glad he figured that out stopped that
one early

[Music]

Powers okay

indices coming in nice yep
properties of powers very good

[Music]

oh negative Powers lovely

[Music]

square roots fractional powers
irrational number there's another one
root two
ah okay
we have I so after e to the I Pi
appeared after Euler's identity a good
two and a bit minutes later
but we do now have square root minus one
is I Okay so we've got complex numbers
all right
wine time
Wine Time

[Music]

oh oh okay
I cubed
racing is it's actually minus I but what
they've done there is written it as I
times e to the I pi
because you minus I is of course minus 1
times I and then if you replace the
minus one with e to the I Pi okay so all
these identities come back nice okay but
powers are complex numbers this is good
this is good it's like where this is
going 10 minutes to go
Eulers Formula
and I see the ears come back it's not
hiding anymore

oh no it's running away

oh little flash there
of Euler's formula so e to the I Pi was
very briefly replaced there by
the uh what was it cos pi plus I sine Pi
so that's generally true Euler's formula
says e to the I Theta is equal to cos
Theta plus I sine Theta very nice very
blinking you'll miss it for that one
Sword Fight

[Music]

foreign
I can't believe I'm watching a sword
fight between the iPhone
I'm having so much fun
okay easy a pie by four very nice
I like how they introduced that on the
angle very clever
okay so there's a lot of nice sort
pause again there was a lot of nice
uh animation and playfulness
let's say around the complex numbers
there so there were lots of arcs and
circles being drawn and that's hinting
at this underlying behavior of e to the
IPI so because e to the I Pi is actually
equal to
um cos pi plus I sine pi and more
generally e to the I Theta is cos theta
plus I sine Theta you can of course map
that into the unit circle so e to the I
Theta will actually describe any point
on the unit circle as you vary Theta
where zero is going to be the x-axis and
then as these are increases you can go
all the way around for 2 pi so that sort
of fight scene between the two of them
it was really nice how the the angle was
changing as they were jumping and the
value is changing there in the ease the
ID so it's very clever like that a lot
very very cool very very cool
Complex Axis
complex axis yeah
and the real number line at
perpendicular
so now he's drawing the circle now he's
figured it out like it
foreign
stopping at six radians because of
course two pi 3.28
6.28 ish would be the full circle
now Israel on the radius yeah there we
go
larger and larger plane okay
increase the radius thing grows very
good
[Music]
there we go oh oh oh new one new one
so it
went to the power series then it
switched to Euler's formula version cos
pi plus I sine pi and now it's gone to
the exponential definition of cos and
sign so cosine of x can be written as
remember this now e to the
I X Plus e to the minus IX divided by 2.
so that's what's happening here so
it's throwing that
one in out of absolutely nowhere
okay now where are
we going next foreign
what's going on here
Infinity Gun

it would appear so
I know we're gonna be able to look at
functions the same again and summation
site they're all just guns
this one badass orange Stickman

oh he's got the infinity side
half of infinity
suppose like all kinds of have it it
sounds about right

oh
so as he's shooting the function at
Infinity gun never thought I'd say that
sentence
it's hitting R and it's turning it into
R2 R3 so I'm guessing each blast of
infinity is adding a new dimension it
would appear here very clever very
clever okay
Transformer
so we get to 4D we get to R4 I'm gonna
remember that

so we've got a combination of
exponentials and series
turning into some kind of Transformer
obviously
oh there's a log very cool there's a log
thrown in there
Movie

this is so entertaining I want to watch
a movie
add 9i shift up nine spaces love it

foreign
so he's now translating himself through
space

the waves of Simon cars beautiful
infinite series down it's not looking
good

very clever that as he changes the
radius the width of the beam changes
because as you would change the radius
your sine and cosine would have a larger
amplitude which is what's giving him a
large beam that is very very cool very
very cool
Inverted World
I'm such a dead

oh

we're in the inverted world oh dear
square roots are negative apparently now
breaking Mass

now they're trying to make friends
beautiful

[Music]

ice
so if I've got this correctly this idea
of sort of flipping to the other
dimension or inverting the black and
white seems to be when you multiply e to
the I Pi by I
they appear to be going into another
dimension that's interesting
suppose ECI Pi is a real number it is -1
and when you multiply by the I you are
going to get minus I and you know for a
while historically complex numbers
square roots minus one square roots of
negative numbers were thought to break
it's a very cool interpretation I think
that's what's going on
my interpretation of it at least
Gamma Function
I to the power four is one very good
because if I squared is minus one
that squared is the same size before
back to the unit circle it's the IPI
now we've got the series oh gamma
function that's a new one right at the
end
so the gamma function has just been
thrown in so the way I think about the
gamma function I actually have a whole
video talking about the gamma function
from quite a while ago one of my first
videos I made
but the way I think about the gamma
function is it's an extension of the
factorial function to
non-integers so if you have a number
like 5 factorial for example and this is
true for any n n factorial 5 factorial
is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.
multiplied together so that's going to
give you a 120 and if you have n
factorial that means n times n minus 1
times M minus 2 times n minus 3 and you
go all the way down and you stop at one
or zero zero factorial one
now the gamma function allows you to
come up with a way of computing
factorials for none integers so you can
do PI factorial and you can make sense
of that through the gamma function so
it's kind of defined through an integral
again watch my video if you want to see
a bit more about where that comes from
didn't know that was going to appear uh
but they've thrown in now the gamma
function in the definition there of your
series that's nice okay
Outro
thank you
and now we're creating all kinds of
weird patterns sure
infinite series of gamma functions as
you do
I knew the zeta function was coming you
knew the zeta function was going
and Delta and Phi beautiful
or maybe it's not the Z to function we
thought they were going to do it with
all this chat about complex numbers
oh okay we're calling that the end so
they're all friends now
beautiful I'm gonna genuinely
that was fantastic
that was so so entertaining well done
Alan Becker I am gonna literally click
subscribe right now I thought that was
that good all right there you go Alan
subscribe that was that was awesome
loved it absolutely loved it the
animation is incredible I'm assuming the
rest of the channel probably has
incredible animation but I'd never seen
it before hadn't heard of the channel
but that was that was something else
that was amazing
um and all of that mass I knew some hard
maths was coming because that is what
I'd seen people talking about on social
media and various things
um I really thought they were going to
throw in the zeta function there at the
end they like teased it with the the
Zita symbol
um but not necessarily the whole
function
um but no that was awesome that was
amazing thank you everyone who suggested
I should watch this thank you Alan
Becker for making that that was
brilliant
um and what a way to talk about and
showcase our beautiful subject
of mathematics so I hope you enjoyed
watching this as I say this was
genuinely my real first ever watch
through of this video
so you've got my real first-hand
reaction uh to watching this masterpiece
absolute Masterpiece of mathematics and
art and animation and everything great
about YouTube that was honestly that's
I'm so happy just having watched that
um but as you say thanks for watching I
hope you enjoyed watching me reacting to
this awesome video I will of course be
back very soon with more of my usual
math style content if you have enjoyed
this please do subscribe to the channel
it's really helpful and otherwise keep
having fun with maths and I'll see you
all very soon take care
